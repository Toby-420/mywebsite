<h1>Kepler Architecture GPU - NVIDIA</h1>
<p>If you didn't already know, the 800 series NVidia mobile GPUs (860m and such) can have massive driver issues</p>
<p>If you just want the fix, download the <a href="https://archive.org/details/391-35-notebook-win-10-64bit-international-whql"target="_blank">NVidia 391.35 driver</a>, and it should fix your issues</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try one of the other drivers on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/nvidia-drivers" target="_blank">NVidia archival project</a>. There are Linux drivers on there as well. If that doesn't fix it, I am sorry, but I have no fix as of writing</p>
<p>This is because NVidia used an architecture called Kepler on these GPUs, but they stopped supporting it for some reason. Even OEMs have no drivers</p>
<p>Do not fall for the lies that they post on their driver download page. They state that their latest drivers work with the 860m, but they do not and give an error such as 'Not compatible with this version of Windows' even if you are fully up to date</p>
<p>I have tried for at least a year to get my old GPU (which is in the laptop I use to write all this website in Notepad++, and develop my games (also in Notepad++)) working and this is the only easy fix I have found that isn't just 'Buy a new GPU, stupid'. I can barely afford one, so that wasn't an option</p>
